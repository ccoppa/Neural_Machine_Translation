# Introduction
In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Model
We will examine the performance of four neural network architectures:

Model 1: Simple RNN

Model 2: RNN with Embedding

Model 3: Bidirectional RNN

Model 4: Encoder-Decoder RNN

## Install
- Python 3.6
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.4
- Keras 2.0
